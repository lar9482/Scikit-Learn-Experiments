This is the repository that I'm using for my TURC project from May to July 2021.


/**
Research Proposal(NOT COMPLETELY ACCURATE)
Software is a useful tool of daily life that needs to be developed and maintained efficiently. Reliability in software can be controlled in its development, deployment, and operation status. The project that I am joining is an ongoing project for effectively predicting the metrics in the development and operation process (DevOps) using machine learning algorithms. 

Dr. Vidhyashree Nagaruju is currently leading this project with a group of x colleagues. I am trying to commit to this project between May 20, 2021, and August 1, 2021, although I am flexible with time commitments. 

Currently, the group has a test environment that is operational. The group is researching techniques that an intelligent agent can follow to predict the DevOps process. Specifically, they are looking into how they can develop a model that can predict DevOps metrics using reinforcement learning techniques. These metrics include the softwareâ€™s reliability, availability, release time, and other characteristics. So far, the group has produced stable results on the environment. This summer, the group is planning on exploring other machine learning algorithms. They are going to decide how these metrics can be allocated for a model to effectively train on the environment. In addition, fine-tuning the environment to efficiently train on other algorithms is expected. 

This project will eventually be deployed as an open-source project for research and the software engineering community. This project has the potential to reduce development time and increase maintenance quality. This will ensure that consumers have high-quality software to use in minimal time

Please note that I'm not currently researching on the reinforcement learning environment(DevOps env).
