The main code is in 'Model.py'

Most of the sci-kit learn implementations are above line 200

Lines 200-267 are I/O implementations for updating the statistics using pandas.
Lines 272-284 are driver methods. 

Again, this file does implement some bad practices(long functions, implementing everything in a single file, etc...)
so don't use this as an example of implementation.

I'll try to clean up the code ASAP.
